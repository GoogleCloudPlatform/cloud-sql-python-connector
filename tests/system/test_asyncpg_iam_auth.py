        user (str):
            The formatted IAM database username.
            e.g., my-email@test.com, service-account@project-id.iam
        db (str):
            The name of the database, e.g., mydb
        refresh_strategy (Optional[str]):
            Refresh strategy for the Cloud SQL Connector. Can be one of "lazy"
            or "background". For serverless environments use "lazy" to avoid
            errors resulting from CPU being throttled.
