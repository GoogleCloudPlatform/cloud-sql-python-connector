## Running tests

### Initial Setup

1. Enable the SQL Admin API.
2. This library uses [Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc]] to 
  automatically detect credentials. Which ever credential you use must have the
  Cloud SQL client role (or equivalent permissions). 
3. You'll need to create several Cloud SQL instances - one for MySQL, Postgres,
  and SQL Server. 
2. Once created, set the following environment variables:
```
export MYSQL_CONNECTION_NAME="your:connection:string"
export MYSQL_USER="db_user"
export MYSQL_PASS="db_pass"
export MYSQL_DB="db_name"

export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_NAME="your:connection:string"
export POSTGRES_USER="db_user"
export POSTGRES_PASS="db_pass"
export POSTGRES_DB="db_name"

# This instance will need to have IAM Database authentication enabled
export POSTGRES_IAM_CONNECTION_NAME="your:connection:string"
export POSTGRES_IAM_USER="iam_user@google.com"

export SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_NAME="your:connection:string"
export SQLSERVER_USER="db_user"
export SQLSERVER_PASS="db_pass"
export SQLSERVER_DB="db_name"
```

### Running tests 

Tests can be run with `nox`. You can install nox with `pip install nox`, and
run specific tests with `nox -s $SESSION_NAME`.

Note: You may need a specific version of python installed to run those tests.
For example, you'll need Python 3.8 installed to run `unit-3.8` or 
`system-3.8`.
